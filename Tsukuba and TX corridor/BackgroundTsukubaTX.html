    <h1>Tsukuba City and the Tsukuba Express corridor</h1>
    <p>Tsukuba Science City was originally a greenfields development plan to relocate a national university 
        and about 43 government research facilities to a location about 60 kilometers north of Tokyo. The site was noteworthy for its 
        lack of convenient transportation<a href="#ref-bloom1981">(Bloom and Asano, 1981)</a>. Covering 2,968 ha, it was the largest 
        of the large-scale suburban residential development projects started in the 1960s<a href="#ref-inui2017">(Inui, 2017)</a>.
